<h1>Simple Random Click Game</h1>

This is an interactive random click game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game generates random shapes (either circles or squares) with different sizes and colors at random positions on the screen. Players need to click on the shapes as quickly as possible. The game records the time taken for each click and the total time taken for all clicks.
